# ztype-score-tracker

A tracking app to record and view Ztype scores. Ztype is a typing gane. Going into Dev Academy, improving my typing speed and accuracy was one of the things that I wanted to do.

This is an updated version of the personal project I completed while at Enspiral Dev Academy.

The original version was completed using Handlebars. It's been updated to React-Redux. I also pulled in D3.js to do the recent scores graph.
